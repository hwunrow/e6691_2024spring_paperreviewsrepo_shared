# e6691_2024spring_paperreviewsrepo_shared

This repo is used for sharing code and other information relevant to topic/paper presentations by students, for course on Advanced Deep Learning in 2024 semester.
* Students should add new directories (if their topic does not have the directory yet)
* * Naming of repos should be descriptive
* Students should upload code relevant to their topic/paper presentations
* * The code should be able to run
  * If the size of data is too large, upload to github should be avoided - the data should be saved and accessible via a link to student's liondrige (make sure that sharing is enabled)
* Jupyter notebooks are particularly useful for demonstrations
* This repo is to be used together with student paper presentations (google slides) located in E6691.20XXspring.studentProjectsAndPapers  in LionDrive
